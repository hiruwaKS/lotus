Classical Grammar-Driven CFL Reachability
==========================================

``CFL/Classical`` is the general grammar-driven part of Lotus's CFL
subsystem. It is independent of the specialized interleaved-Dyck and MCFL
solver representations.

Architecture
------------

The public and implementation trees mirror the same responsibility-based
layout:

``Core/``
   Canonical grammar, labeled graph, relation storage, and validation.

``Solvers/SolverSession``
   Public backend selection, incremental session state, and solver
   orchestration.

``Solvers/Engines/``
   Reusable relation engines. ``TransitiveClosure`` is the generic incremental
   closure engine. ``Engines/PEARL/``, ``Engines/POCR/``, ``Engines/SQID/``,
   ``Engines/STG/``, ``Engines/Skewed/``, ``Engines/EndpointQuotient/``,
   ``Engines/CAT/``, and ``Engines/IEOCE/`` contain the paper algorithms;
   ``Engines/CERT/`` is the Lotus-native cardinality-certified engine.
   ``Engines/POCR/`` also contains the client grammars.

``Solvers/Preprocessing/``
   Graph simplification and RSM-guided foldability analysis.

``Solvers/ConstraintGrounding``
   The separate structural constraint-grounding analysis.

``Clients/Alias/``
   PAG/PEG encoding, Aser synchronization, and the LLVM alias facade.

``Clients/ValueFlow/``
   SVFG preparation, encoding, and context-sensitive value-flow queries.

``Grammar``
   Parses declared start, terminal, and nonterminal symbols; normalizes
   whitespace-delimited ``*`` and ``?`` EBNF; binarizes long productions; and
   compiles string symbols to stable integer IDs. ``GrammarParseOptions``
   instantiates correlated attributed symbols such as ``call_i``/``ret_i``
   using variable-specific or per-symbol domains. Graph labels provide domains
   automatically when the command-line driver is used. Only ``<epsilon>`` is
   reserved for epsilon; ``e`` and ``epsilon`` are ordinary terminals. A
   configurable expansion limit rejects independent attribute domains whose
   Cartesian product would grow unexpectedly large. The former independent
   ``CNFGrammar`` parser/transformer has been removed; this is the only grammar
   normalization implementation.

``LabeledGraph``
   Stores the base problem boundary. Solver sessions keep derived facts in a
   separate relation; only explicit incremental terminal additions modify the
   graph. Text, DOT, and JSON readers are available; DOT accepts quoted IDs and
   JSON has an explicit ``nodes``/``vertices`` section for isolated vertices.
   Plain, reverse, and bidirectional transformations are explicit. Forward and
   reverse label indices support direct incoming-edge queries.

``Relation``
   Separates terminal and derived facts from the graph frontend. Sparse-set,
   LLVM sparse-bitvector, and endpoint-quotient implementations provide indexed
   successor and predecessor lookup and streaming edge enumeration.

``SolverSession``
   Retains a relation and worklist across calls. ``addTerminalEdge`` followed
   by ``solve`` supports clients that discover constraints incrementally.
   Nullable self-facts are seeded only for newly added nodes.

``Solvers/Engines/POCR/ClientGrammars``
   Holds POCR's exact standard and grammar-rewritten production tables for the
   alias and value-flow engines. These are data selections over the shared
   solver, not additional clients.

Solver backends
---------------

``SparseSet``
   Conventional indexed worklist saturation with hash-set relations.

``SparseBitVector``
   The same worklist algorithm with per-node, per-symbol LLVM sparse
   bitvectors. This is a storage choice, not the POCR algorithm.

``Graspan``
   Executes POCR's source-ordered epoch/delta evaluation. Each source combines
   its ``old`` and ``new`` facts in the same four phases as
   ``GspanAA``/``GspanVFA``, then immediately updates that source's two
   relations. Old sources are revisited while any middle-node delta remains.

``Pearl``
   Implements ASE 2023 multi-derivation with separate non-transitive,
   partially transitive, and fully transitive propagation. Select it with
   ``--solver pearl``.

``Sqid``
   Implements OOPSLA 2026 adaptive and differential relation chaining with
   dual old/delta graph views. Select it with ``--solver sqid``.

``Skewed``
   Implements the PLDI 2024 skewed-tabulation worklist with separate indexed
   (E) and propagating (PE) facts. Select it with ``--solver skewed``. The
   general ``SolverSession`` backend preserves Lotus's complete-relation
   contract and safely rebuilds after terminal-edge or isolated-node updates,
   because old PE facts are not indexed as future join candidates. The engine
   API also exposes the supplied conservative target-only static rewrite; it
   is intentionally not enabled by the complete-relation backend.

``Cat``
   Implements ICSE 2026 context-aware tabulation with per-symbol usage
   contexts and guarded transitivity rewrites. Select it with ``--solver cat``.

``Iea``
   Implements OOPSLA 2024 iterative-epoch online cycle elimination. Select it
   with ``--solver iea``.

``IeaOcr``
   IEA with online cycle reduction and minimum-equivalent graphs. Select it
   with ``--solver iea-ocr``.

``TransitiveClosure``
   Uses sparse bitvectors generally and a dedicated incremental forward/reverse
   bitvector closure for every production ``X -> X X``. Inserting ``u -> v``
   crosses predecessors of ``u`` with successors of ``v``. It does not retain
   copied reachability trees or a second hash-set closure.

``Pocr``
   Ports POCR's paired predecessor-tree/successor-tree propagation to Lotus
   containers. Primary arcs and secondary closure facts follow the original
   FIFO scheduling, and linear-recursive rules use early-pruned tree traversal
   instead of generic relation joins. Sparse bitvectors expose the complete
   relation to clients and preserve non-empty-path reflexive pairs introduced
   by cycles.

``HierarchicalPocr``
   Uses the same paired-tree closure as ``Pocr`` and prioritizes facts for
   transitive symbols ahead of the ordinary grammar worklist. Select it with
   ``--solver hpocr``.

``FullyOrdered``
   Ports FOCR's forward/backward edge-critical-graph maintenance. The critical
   graph is a reduced reachability skeleton, while the public relation remains
   the complete exact CFL relation. Select it with ``--solver focr``; add
   ``--focr-scc`` for POCR's optional critical-graph cycle simplification.

``EndpointQuotient``
   Select with ``--solver endpoint-quotient``. Retains exact reachability as
   cells over grammar-dependent source and target partitions, with nullable
   diagonals represented separately. Solving and ordinary queries do not
   materialize the complete concrete relation. Identical partitions, lifts,
   and bridges are shared; dense identity-lift joins propagate bitmap deltas.
   Other joins use indexed cell traversal and cache repeated nontrivial lift
   products. Temporary join indexes and grammar plans are released after solving.

   The endpoint engine implements ``Relation`` directly. It buffers new input
   facts and builds refined partitions on the next ``solve()``. The previous
   compressed closure is migrated into those partitions as already-processed
   cells, so saturation visits only facts induced by the delta. Until that
   solve completes, queries see the previous snapshot (or an empty relation
   before the first solve). An unchanged solve performs no new solver work.
   Adding an isolated node also invalidates the snapshot, so nullable facts
   for that node appear after the next solve.
   Alias-client grammar extensions rebuild from the encoded input graph;
   they do not expand and reinsert the previous quotient closure as axioms.

``CertCFL``
   Select with ``--solver cert-cfl``. Cardinality-certified exact all-symbol
   solving: universal-degree certificates and a finite threshold domain
   promote dense blocks to exactness, with symbolic nullable identity.
   ``observed`` must remain unset and ``unidirectional`` is rejected. The
   kernel is available directly for selected-symbol observation contracts.
   See :doc:`/cfl/classical/cert_cfl` for the promotion rules, resource
   limits, and the completed-snapshot adapter contract.

All backends return exactly the same grammar-relative relation. Tests compare
their complete triples, not only start-symbol answers, against an independent
cubic recognizer and exercise incremental additions and non-nullable cycles.

``ConstraintGroundingSolver`` is separate: it computes structural set-variable
grounding statistics and does not expose a CFL node-pair relation.

Querying compressed results
---------------------------

Clients use the same relation interface for every backend:

.. code-block:: cpp

   const auto &relation = session.relation();
   const auto symbol = grammar.symbolId("S");
   bool reachable = relation.contains(symbol, source, target);

   relation.forEachSuccessor(symbol, source, [&](NodeId target) {
     consumeTarget(target);
   });

   // Return false to stop; visitEdges returns false when stopped early.
   relation.visitEdges(symbol, [&](const RelationEdge &edge) {
     return consumeEdgeAndContinue(edge);
   });

``visitSuccessors`` and ``visitPredecessors`` also support early termination;
the ``forEach`` variants take void callbacks. ``visitEdges(visitor)`` visits all
symbols, and ``visitEdges(symbol, visitor)`` visits only the selected symbol.
Traversal order is unspecified, facts are unique, and callbacks must not
mutate or solve the relation. ``edges()`` and ``edges(symbol)`` explicitly
collect a vector when the caller needs owned results or sorting.

The endpoint backend expands only the queried source row or target column
for local enumeration. Full enumeration necessarily takes time proportional
to the output, but does not allocate a full result vector. Nullable diagonals
are included exactly once, even when a positive-length cycle also reaches
the same node. The standalone endpoint ``Solver`` additionally exposes
``forEachPositiveRectangle`` for clients that process whole compressed blocks.

``edgeCount`` reads cached exact counts. Session ``Count`` statistics exclude
self-pairs and deduplicate overlapping symbols; the endpoint backend computes
this union by grouping equivalent source rows, without storing all concrete
pairs. ``relation_payload_bytes_estimate`` measures retained compressed
containers and buffered inputs, excluding allocator overhead and temporary
peak solve memory. Endpoint statistics expose partition/bridge/lift builds,
insertion attempts, duplicate inserts, skipped repeated binary outputs, and
bitmap join words. ``binary_joins`` still counts compatible cell pairs even
when a bitmap operation handles many of them at once. Core phase timings
exclude snapshot replacement and session-level statistics; use the session's
``solve_time_microseconds`` for end-to-end solve timing.

POCR support utilities
----------------------

``GraphSimplification`` ports the client preprocessing passes without SVF:
direct-edge SCC elimination, PEG/IVFG folding, common-dereference merging, and
FastDyck-style pruning of non-contributing edges. The general driver exposes
these through ``--scc-elimination``, ``--graph-folding``,
``--interdyck-pruning``, and ``--simplification-flavor alias|value-flow``.
Direct foldable pairs are collected once after SCC elimination; alias
common-dereference merging and FastDyck then use their own worklists, preserving
the original phase boundaries.

``RecursiveStateMachine`` and ``FoldabilityChecker`` implement POCR's RSM
transition semantics and node-pair foldability proof. These utilities remain
available through their C++ APIs and unit tests.

``SolverOptions::unidirectional`` implements POCR's ``Insert``/``Follow``
summarization discipline. All facts remain available as exact output, while
only terminals, nullable seeds, and ``Insert`` symbols are indexed as future
join candidates. Use ``--unidirectional`` in the general driver.

See :doc:`/cfl/classical/pocr_migration` for the complete source-to-Lotus mapping and the
algorithms intentionally merged with an existing implementation.

published algorithms, Lotus adaptations, and validation boundaries.

Adapters
--------

Adapter implementations are split by dependency:

``CanaryClassicalCFLAliasClient``
   PAG and PEG encodings, ``AliasClient``, and ``solveToFixedPoint`` for
   alternating client-defined discovery with incremental saturation. PEG
   loads and stores added after solving are converted through existing or
   reusable synthetic dereference nodes. For PAG input, ``AliasClient`` lowers
   ``load``/``store`` constraints in one structural pass, using indexed
   address-taken objects or one reusable synthetic dereference per pointer.
   Unknown raw terminals remain hard errors rather than being ignored.

``CanaryClassicalCFLValueFlowClient``
   SVFG preparation, value-flow encoding, ``ValueFlowClient``, and its
   grammar-driven client integration.

``AserConstraintAdapter.h``
   A header-only converter from Lotus's native AserPTA constraint graph to the
   alias client input. A client-provided offset resolver preserves field GEP
   attributes, while ``AserAliasSynchronizer`` maps new Aser nodes and
   constraints into successive ``solveToFixedPoint`` rounds, including when
   PEG has inserted synthetic nodes. Newly observed GEP attributes are batched
   per synchronization round so the grammar is extended and parsed once.

``LLVMCFLAliasAnalysis`` / ``lotus-cfl-alias``
   Build Aser's constraint/model frontend without running its points-to
   solver. A lightweight projection from solved CFL value aliases to explicit
   address-taken function objects resolves indirect and intercepted calls;
   normal Aser callbacks then create actual/formal, return, heap, and newly
   reached function constraints. Constant global initializers and pointer-bearing
   ``memcpy`` operations receive explicit constraints when the Aser frontend
   does not emit them. Supplemental ``memcpy``/``memmove`` constraints are
   field/range-aware and are revisited after newly discovered callees add
   nodes. Unmapped pointers and mapped results of unsupported pointer-producing
   LLVM instructions are conservatively reported as may-alias; explicit
   unknown facts propagate through SSA uses and affected memory rather than
   being converted into a no-alias result.

   ``AliasClient::pointsTo`` is an object-valued relation derived directly
   from address, copy, GEP, load, and store constraints. It represents fixed
   fields with allocation-plus-cumulative-offset objects. Variant GEPs retain
   a known offset congruence (for example, an array-element stride) when LLVM
   can provide one and otherwise use an arbitrary-offset field object.
   Synthetic field objects can be projected to their allocation with
   ``baseObject``. This full object relation is computed lazily only for
   ``pointsTo`` or enhanced alias queries; ordinary solving and indirect-call
   discovery do not run a second pointer-analysis fixed point.

``ValueFlowClient`` / ``lotus-cfl-vf``
   Implement SVF's second classical-CFL client, ``CFLVF``. The driver builds
   Lotus's AserPTA-backed SVFG and MemorySSA, removes dereference inputs and
   stale strong-update flow, keeps ``direct``, ``indirect``, and ``thread``
   terminals distinct, and encodes
   call/return edges as matched ``call_i``/``ret_i`` terminals, and solves
   context-sensitive value-flow reachability with any classical backend.
   ``hasBalancedFlow`` (and the compatibility spelling ``hasFlow``) queries
   the same-context summary relation ``A``. ``hasRealizableFlow`` queries
   ``R``, which additionally permits unmatched returns at the beginning and
   unmatched calls at the end while retaining callsite matching for balanced
   pairs. The derived relations are the sound union of the edge categories,
   not a path-feasibility or memory-object proof.

SVFG strong-update preparation requires explicit ``isSingleton`` metadata,
nonrecursive stack ownership, and evidence that the LLVM store overwrites the
whole represented object. Loop/recursive allocations and partial writes retain
weak-update input flow.

Alias and value-flow relation queries require ``solve()`` first and throw a
``logic_error`` when called on an unsolved client.

``ReachabilityStats`` separates session snapshots (graph/relation sizes and
payload estimates) from work performed by the current ``solve()`` call
(iterations, duplicates, peak worklist, timing, and transitive propagation).
``solveToFixedPoint`` sums per-call work and retains the final snapshots.
The LLVM alias facade additionally reports ``frontend_time_microseconds``,
``client_initialization_microseconds``, and
``client_discovery_microseconds`` so encoding/synchronization costs remain
distinguishable from solver time on whole-program workloads.


Command line
------------

.. code-block:: console

   cmake --build build --target lotus-cfl-solve lotus-cfl-alias lotus-cfl-vf
   build/bin/lotus-cfl-solve \
     --grammar grammar.txt --graph graph.txt --solver sparse-bitvector --json-stats

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-alias --solver sparse-bitvector --encoding cfl-peg \
     --check-annotations module.bc

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-vf --solver transitive-closure \
     --query main::source,main::sink module.bc

The LLVM frontends can also export their normalized CFL instance for replay by
any graph-level backend:

.. code-block:: console

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-alias --encoding cfl-peg \
     --dump-cfl-graph module.peg --dump-cfl-grammar alias.grammar module.bc

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-vf --encoding classical-cfl \
     --dump-cfl-graph module.vfg --dump-cfl-grammar value-flow.grammar module.bc

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-solve --graph module.vfg \
     --grammar value-flow.grammar --solver pocr --result-scope count

The native value-flow encoding remains the default. ``classical-cfl`` projects
all ordinary SVFG edges to ``a`` and preserves context with ``call_i`` and
``ret_i``. The exported graph records isolated nodes, and the exported grammar
preserves ``Insert``, ``Follow``, and ``Count`` metadata, so replay retains the
same nullable and target-relation semantics.

Alias encodings are intentionally distinct. ``cfl-peg`` is the recommended
default and the interchange-compatible ``a/d/f_i`` analysis. ``pag`` keeps the
constraint-level formulation for diagnostics and comparisons. ``peg`` is the
Lotus extended grammar with ``ArrayPath`` and ``Memcpy`` summaries. Removing
the latter two would discard different analysis semantics rather than merely
remove duplicate serializations.

.. code-block:: console

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-solve \
     --grammar grammar.txt --graph graph.txt --solver pocr --json-stats

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-solve \
     --grammar pocr.cfg --graph input.peg --solver graspan \
     --unidirectional --simplification-flavor alias --simplify-graph

External graph/grammar datasets can select their declared ``Count`` relation
without going through an LLVM frontend. Backends that support target-projected
evaluation use that scope during solving; other backends compute their full
relation and filter the reported output:

.. code-block:: console

   build/bin/lotus-cfl-solve \
     --grammar benchmarks/real-world/CFL/Classical/grammars/aa.ecfg \
     --graph benchmarks/real-world/CFL/Classical/spec2017/pegs/lbm.g \
     --graph-mode plain \
     --solver skewed --result-scope count --json-stats

When a target-projected backend consumes a transformed grammar, its ``Follow``
set supplies the exact propagating nonterminals. Default solver sessions remain
all-symbol and therefore preserve the complete ``Relation`` contract used by
the LLVM clients. Dataset-specific batch policy is kept outside the binary in
``scripts/cfl/run_cfl_dataset.py``.

Use ``--graph-mode plain|matrix|pag-matrix`` and
``--direction plain|reverse|bidirectional`` to state input semantics.
Attributed domains are inferred from graph labels. ``--attribute-domain`` can
override a variable (``var:i=1,2``) or symbol kind (``kind:call=1,2``).
``--relation-output``, ``--graph-output``, ``--stats-output``,
``--start-only``, and ``--validate-only`` support reproducible batch workflows.
JSON statistics
include grammar/graph sizes, worklist behavior, estimated container payload,
timings, transitive-closure propagation, POCR tree, and FOCR critical-graph
statistics. Payload estimates are not RSS or allocator measurements and must
not be used as real memory totals.

Input formats
-------------

Text graphs contain one ``source,target,label`` edge per line. POCR/SVF-style
tabular ``source target label [attribute]`` files (including ``.peg`` and
``.vfg``) are accepted directly; ``call_i 7`` is normalized to ``call_7``.
POCR's singular ``Production:`` grammar syntax and ``Insert:``, ``Follow:``,
and ``Count:`` sections are parsed natively. In this legacy syntax an indexed
LHS derived from non-indexed symbols receives index zero, and an ``_i`` graph
edge without an explicit fourth field is likewise normalized to index zero,
matching POCR. The line-oriented DOT subset
accepts quoted IDs and ``label=...`` edge attributes; JSON accepts ``nodes`` or
``vertices`` plus labeled ``edges``.
